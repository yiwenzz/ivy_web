<h1 id="a-random-blog-from-the-weekend-readings">A Random blog from the weekend readings</h1>

<p>I would really love to see at least one blog posted for each week. However, that is not likely to happen since life is hard, with no exception to myself. So, I have made this small goal of posting a blog of my readings. This week’s topic is about quantitative terminology. On this page, I have listed some definitions of terms in statistics. Sources are from Google, textbook (<em>Social Statistics for a Diverse Society</em> by Chava Frankfort-Nachmias and Anna Leon-Guerrero 2011), and some of my own knowledge):</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frequency: it is the occurrence of an event within certain measurement, e.g., flip a coin 100 times, count to find out the frequency when heads will be shown as a result.</li>
<li>Percentage: percentage is the probability of an event to happen over one hundred. As we know, the probability cannot be smaller than 0 and bigger than 1.</li>
<li>Cumulative distribution function: it is the distribution function that is cumulative. Usually, probability distributions are typically defined in terms of the probability density function.</li>
<li>Proportions: fraction of the total that possesses a certain attribute.</li>
<li>Rates: occurrence of events over a specific interval in time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="graphic-representation">Graphic Representation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pie charts: showing percentage and proportion.</li>
<li>Histograms: used for plotting the frequency of score occurrences in a continuous data set that has been divided into classes.</li>
<li>Line graph: display information as a series of points.</li>
<li>Bar graph: compare things in different groups.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>

<ul>
<li>Population: a group that includes all the cases in which the research is interested.</li>
<li>Sample: a subset of cases selected from a population.</li>
<li>Parameter and statistic: parameters are measures used to describe the population and distribution (e.g., mean, std).</li>
<li>Statistic: a measure used to describe sample distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sampling-approaches">Sampling approaches</h2>

<ul>
<li>Simple random sampling

<ul>
<li>Every member of population has an equal chance of being chosen.</li>
<li>Every combination of N members has an equal chance of being chosen.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Systematic random sampling

<ul>
<li>Every K-th member in the total population is chosen for inclusion in the sample after the first member of the sample is selected at random. K usually is the ratio obtained by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stratified random sampling

<ul>
<li>Dividing the population into subgroups based on one or more variables central to the analysis.</li>
<li>Draw an SRS from each of the subgroups.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
