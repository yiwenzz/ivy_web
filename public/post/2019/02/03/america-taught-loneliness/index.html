<h2>America-taught Loneliness</h2>
<p>Once I was told that “you should learn to be alone and learn how not to be lonely by just yourself.” There is an old saying goes “Being alone enables a person to become independent and strong.” It is however true, the skill has yet to be learned.</p>
<p>Some facts from the nature: many species are dependent on their gregarious characteristics, such as wolves, lions, elephants, etc. The collective way of preying and inhabiting is probably the best way to survive and incubate their offspring in the wild environment.</p>
<p>Same concepts can be applied to the human race. Think back to when we are little kids, under the parenting protection, our parents always give their best to us. The care, love and support they devote to us made us better people. My father used to tell me “I raise you not because it’s part of my parent responsibility, but the responsibility to the community. My bottom line is that you don’t do anything that harms the society.” Those words always crack me up. Because first, I think his goal has accomplished; second, I think he was talking to an inmate, instead of his own blood.</p>
<p>To become a better profession, we all have our own ways. Mine is through this America-taught loneliness. In the Eastern world communities, people usually mix their life with work. For a typical example, my friends are those whom I work with. However, that is not true in the Western world. Westerners like to separate their work from their life. There is this clear boundary which clearly states “work” on the left, and “life” on the right. I think this is quite effective in terms of getting work done and living a better life. So, I appreciate that, the Western world, although I am still on the learning curve.</p>
