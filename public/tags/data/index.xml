      <description>Introduction The goal of this study is to look at:
 What is the relationships between the population and other variables, such as education attainment, poverty, the mean of income, and the median house value. Visually display the distribution of median house values across the state, and three frequency distributions based on the population of a county. All counties are evenly divided into three tiers:  Tier 1: population size from 3,000 to 11,000 (33 counties) Tier 2: population size form 11,000 to 20,000 (33 counties) Tier 3: population size form 20,000 to 48,200 (33 counties)  Correlations between:  Number of bechelor received and number of poverty.</description>

      <description>This is a brief introduction to text analysis by using python. To be general, the processes are as follows:
 Set up correct working directory for importing document to process. Import .txt files in Python. Work towards the clean dataset as needed. Visualize data as requested.  There are many different ways to clean the dataset and alternate algorithms for text analysis. The following is the code along with some explaination of what I have learned for processing texts.</description>
