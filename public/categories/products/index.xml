      <description>Load Packages In order to accomplish these following tasks:
 Data manipulation Correlation Histogram Visualization 2-sample t test  I use the these following packages in R:
library(dplyr) library(magrittr) library(ggplot2) library(ggpubr) library(psych) library(Hmisc) library(devtools)  Import Data I used a .csv file to store all collected data from the U.S. Census. My target are 99 counties of the state of Iowa.
my_data &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;/Users/yiwenw/Desktop/741 data/Iowa.csv&amp;quot;, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)  Check Variables By using head, we are able to check all variables collected for future data analysis.</description>

      <description>This is a brief introduction to text analysis by using python. To be general, the processes are as follows:
 Set up correct working directory for importing document to process. Import .txt files in Python. Work towards the clean dataset as needed. Visualize data as requested.  There are many different ways to clean the dataset and alternate algorithms for text analysis. The following is the code along with some explaination of what I have learned for processing texts.</description>

      <description>Binet’s Formula The Binet’s formula is also known as the explicit expression of n-th term of the Fibbonacci Sequence.

If we think back to our childhood, other than simple vocabulary like “daddy” and “mommy”, the most common thing was to count the numbers from one to ten. In this case, counting could be the first exposure to mathematics for many people.</description>
