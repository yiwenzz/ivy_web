      <description>This is a brief introduction to text analysis by using python. To be general, the processes are as follows:
 Set up correct working directory for importing document to process. Import .txt files in Python. Work towards the clean dataset as needed. Visualize data as requested.  There are many different ways to clean the dataset and alternate algorithms for text analysis. The following is the code along with some explaination of what I have learned for processing texts.</description>

      <description>Binet’s Formula The Binet’s formula is also known as the explicit expression of n-th term of the Fibbonacci Sequence.
Introduction Counting is a very basic skill. We have all been learning how to count since we were very young. If we think back to our childhood, other than simple vocabulary like “daddy” and “mommy”, the most common thing was to count the numbers from one to ten. In this case, counting could be the first exposure to mathematics for many people.</description>
