# A Random blog from the weekend readings

I would really love to have at least one blog posted at weekly basis. However, that is not likely to happen since life is hard, with no exception to myself. So, I have made this small goal of posting a blog of my readings from time to time. This week’s topic is about the quantitative terminology. In this blog, I will list definitions and terms that are very often used in statistics. Sources and references are from Google, *Social Statistics for a Diverse Society* by Chava Frankfort-Nachmias and Anna Leon-Guerrero (2011), and some of own interpretations.

## Definitions

* Frequency: it is the occurrence of an event within certain measurement, e.g., flip a coin 100 times, count to find out the frequency when heads will be shown as a result.
* Percentage: percentage is the probability of an event to happen over one hundred. As we know, the probability cannot be smaller than 0 and bigger than 1.
* Cumulative distribution function: it is the distribution function that is cumulative. Usually, probability distributions are typically defined in terms of the probability density function.
* Proportions: fraction of the total that possesses a certain attribute.
* Rates: occurrence of events over a specific interval in time.

## Graphic Representation

* Pie charts: showing percentage and proportion.
* Histograms: used for plotting the frequency of score occurrences in a continuous data set that has been divided into classes.
* Line graph: display information as a series of points.
* Bar graph: compare things in different groups.

## Sampling

* 	Population: a group that includes all the cases in which the research is interested.
* 	Sample: a subset of cases selected from a population.
*   Parameter and statistic: parameters are measures used to describe the population and distribution (e.g., mean, std).
* 	Statistic: a measure used to describe sample distribution.

## Sampling approaches

* Simple random sampling
  * Every member of population has an equal chance of being chosen.
  * Every combination of N members has an equal chance of being chosen.
* Systematic random sampling
  * Every K-th member in the total population is chosen for inclusion in the sample after the first member of the sample is selected at random. K usually is the ratio obtained by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
* Stratified random sampling
  * Dividing the population into subgroups based on one or more variables central to the analysis.
  * Draw an SRS from each of the subgroups.
