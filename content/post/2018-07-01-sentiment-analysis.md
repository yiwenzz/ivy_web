Contemporary sentiment analysis has been applied to online customer reviews (Amazon kind of basis). Robust computational algorithm has been applied to online flight ticket sales.

The idea of this project is to use the same knowledge developed by computer scientists Liu in 2014 to grab studentsâ€™ reviews for their taken online courses. However, it can be challenging in the following aspects:

* Online forum data privacy regarding the students and the institutions.
* Basic web developoinig knowledge and tools are required.


The process of conducting the research includes:

1. Retriving
2. Parsing
3. Exploring & Analyzing
4. Visualizing

***


Implications:

* Find what students like/dislike about the course.
* Program/instructor evaluation.
* References for future students and program/course managers.
