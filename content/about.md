Hi, this is Yiwen, a graduate student studying at University of Kansas. My research interests intersect on a variety of areas, such as data analysis, text mining, government relationships and social network analysis. I did my undergraduate work in mathematics, specialized in counting and combinatorics. I believe that math truly enables me to better understand many scholarly publications. It also helps me to communicate in many ways, for instance, I like to study the emotions in tweets, which requires a quantitative understanding of text-based data. However, I always realize my mathematical skills are far limited to be able to conduct many interesting and profound researches. Hence, I aim to learn more in applied mathematics.
