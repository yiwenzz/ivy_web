My name is Yiwen, a graduate student studying in University of Kansas. My research interests span a variety of areas, such as data analysis, data visualization, text mining and others. I had my undergraduate study in mathematics, which is good and bad. I guess there is more good than bad. Math enables me to understand and manipulate data sets. The bad thing is that math is a black hole. I used to have no feeling about math due to the fact I used to know nothing about applied mathematics. Until now, I realized my math skills are too limited to be able to conduct a lot of researches. Hence, I am aiming to become a mathematician, or at least one half is good enough.
