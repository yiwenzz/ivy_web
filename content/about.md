Hi, this is Yiwen, a graduate student studying at University of Kansas studying Urban Planning. My research interests span on a variety of areas, such as data analysis, data visualization, text mining and social network analysis. I did my undergraduate study in mathematics, specialized in counting and combinatorics. I want to say that I am not brave enough to love math. But Math truly enables me to better understand and work with or even manipulate different types of numbers (datasets). On the other hand, math is a black hole. You have to pretend you are eager to learn more in order to learn more. (No, you do not!) I used to have not enough feelings about math due to the fact that I was not exposed to applied mathematics. Until now, I realized my mathematical skills are far limited to be able to conduct many interesting and profound researches. Hence, I am aiming to become a statistician and data scientist.
