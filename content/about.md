My name is Yiwen, a graduate student studying at University of Kansas. My research interests span a variety of areas, such as data analysis, data visualization, text mining and others. My undergraduate study devotes to mathematics, which is good and bad. I guess there is more good than bad. Math enables me to understand, work with or even manipulate different types of numbers (datasets). The bad thing is that math is a black hole. I used to have no feeling about math due to the fact I used to know nothing about applied mathematics. Until now, I realized my mathematical skills are limited to be able to conduct a lot of interesting and profound researches. Hence, I am aiming to become a statistician and data scientist.
